# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This documentation site was generated to help provide developers with documentation for the various packages I [*(AsynchronousMatrix)*](https://github.com/4x8Matrix) develop in my free time.

## Installation

### Wally

All packages are managed through Wally, the Roblox package manager.

### Binaries

If wally isn't a viable option in your codebase, you can alternativly download any of the above packages through the 'Binaries' folder on the GitHub repository;

https://github.com/4x8Matrix/Package-Index/tree/Master/Binaries

These binaries are exported as *rbxm* files, so you'll need to import them into studio through the 'Insert from File' context action, or by dragging and dropping them into the place!
