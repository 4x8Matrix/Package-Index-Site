# State
The `State` class represents an object that wraps around a single Value in the Roblox ecosystem. State is NOT immutable, meaning any/all data that the State is handling will NOT account for changes to that value outside of State.

---

There is quite a few features that have been bundled into State, however Developers do not need to take advantage of them all, here's a small rundown of what you Can do with state:

- Record/Save previous states
	- For an example, this can come in handy if you need to record the player keystrokes
- QoL functions for mutating state
	- State implements several QoL functions *(for ex: `Increment`, `Decrement`)* to allow developers to quickly mutate state without getting and setting values.
- Support for Roblox Attributes
	- State will track and update Roblox Attributes on an Object, this can help quite a bit to remove the Roblox boilerplate for tracking when an Attribute has changed.
