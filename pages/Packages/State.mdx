# State
The `State` class represents an object that wraps around a Roblox datatype. State is NOT immutable, meaning any/all data that the State is handling will NOT account for changes to that value outside of State.

---

There is quite a few features that have been bundled into State, however Developers do not need to take advantage of them all, here's a small rundown of what you can do with state:

- Record/Save previous states
	- For an example, this can come in handy if you need to record the player keystrokes
- QoL functions for mutating state
	- State implements several QoL functions *(for ex: `Increment`, `Decrement`)* to allow developers to quickly mutate state without getting and setting values.
- Support for Roblox Attributes
	- State will track and update Roblox Attributes on an Object, this can help quite a bit to remove the Roblox boilerplate for tracking when an Attribute has changed.

## Properties
### Value
> State.Value \<any>



### Changed
> State.Changed \<[RBXScriptSignal](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/reference/engine/datatypes/RBXScriptSignal)>



### Destroyed
> State.Destroyed \<[RBXScriptSignal](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/reference/engine/datatypes/RBXScriptSignal)>



## Methods
### SetRecordingState

> State:SetRecordingState( `isRecording` [boolean](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/booleans) ) -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Sets the state of recording, when recording all states will be saved into a history of states

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
	A single state object can only save up to **15** previous states!
</Callout>

```lua
	local NumberState = State.new(0)
	
	NumberState:SetRecordingState(true)
```

---
### GetRecord

> State:GetRecord( `count` [number?](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/numbers) ) ->  \{ [number]: any } 

Retrieves an array of previous states that have been set

```lua
	local NumberState = State.new(0)
	
	NumberState:SetRecordingState(true)

	for index = 1, 5 do
		NumberState:Set(index)
	end

	print(NumberState:GetRecord(3)) --> {
	--		[1] = 0,
	--		[2] = 1,
	--		[3] = ...
	--	}
```

---
### Destroy

> State:Destroy() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Safe way to remove references to the `Value` as well as removing any generated content

```lua
	local Value = State.new(0)

	...

	Value:Destroy()
```

---
### Set

> State:Set( `value` any ) -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Set the value of a state, when setting a state the 'Changed' signal will invoke.

```lua
	local Value = State.new(0)

	Value:Set(1)
```

---
### Increment

> State:Increment( `value` [number](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/numbers) ) -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Increments the value by a given input

```lua
	local value = State.new(5)
		:Increment(5)

	print(value:Get()) -- 10
```

---
### Decrement

> State:Decrement( `value` [number](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/numbers) ) -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Decrement the value by a given input

```lua
	local value = State.new(10)
		:Decrement(5)

	print(value:Get()) -- 5
```

---
### Concat

> State:Concat( `value` [string](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/strings) ) -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Concat the value by a given input

```lua
	local Value = State.new("Hello ")
		:Concat("World!")

	print(value:Get()) -- Hello World!
```

---
### Update

> State:Update( `transformFn` (value: any) -> any ) -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Will change the value of the state to the result of the transform function

```lua
	local Value = State.new("Hello ")
		:Update(function(value)
			return value .. "World!"
		end)

	print(value:Get()) -- Hello World!
```

---
### Get

> State:Get() ->  any 

Fetches the value that the State currently holds.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
	As an alternative, `State` offers a `.Value` property which you can directly refer to.
</Callout>

```lua
	local Value = State.new(0)
	local resolve = Value:Get()
```

---
### Observe

> State:Observe( `callbackFn` (oldValue: any, newValue: any) -> () ) ->  [RBXScriptConnection](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/reference/engine/datatypes/RBXScriptConnection) 

Quick QoL function to observe any changes made to the states value, this will invok the callback function with the current value as soon as an :Observe call has been made.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
	Be cautious when refering to the RBXScriptConnection `:Observe` returns, as the first callback function will be invoked before this connection is returned!
</Callout>

```lua
	local Value = State.new(0)

	Value:Observe(function(oldValue, newValue)
		doSomething(oldValue, newValue)
	end)
```

---
### ToString

> State:ToString() ->  [string](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/strings) 

Returns a prettified string version of the state table.

```lua
	local Value = State.new(0)

	print(tostring(Value)) -- Value<0>
```

---
## Functions
### new

> State.new( `value` any ) ->  State 

Constructor function used to generate a new 'State' object

```lua
	local object = State.new("Hello, World!")

	...
```

---
### fromAttribute

> State.fromAttribute( `object` [Instance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/reference/engine/datatypes/Instance), `attribute` [string](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/strings) ) ->  State 

Wrapper for `State.new` however wraps around a Roblox attribute, the State object will always have the latest attribute value.

```lua
	local object = State.fromAttribute(workspace.object, "attributeName")

	...
```

---
### is

> State.is( `object` State? ) ->  [boolean?](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/booleans) 

Validate if an object is a 'State' object

```lua
	local object = State.new("Hello, World!")

	if State.is(object) then
		...
	end
```
