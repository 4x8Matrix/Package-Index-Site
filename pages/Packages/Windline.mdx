# Windline
Windline is a simple module to help create streaks of wind in a Roblox experience, this module was NOT created by me! This is a package that was created
	by Boatbomber! ( boatbomber - https://boatbomber.com )

I have made small QoL adjustments and uploaded this module to Wally since there's not a version already avaliable.

## Properties
## Methods
### Init

> Windline:Init( `settings` \{ Lifetime: number?, Direction: Vector3?, Speed: number?, SpawnRate: number? } ) -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

The initiation function that'll enable the Windlines module to spawn 3d windlines/streaks \<SpawnRate> times a minute.

- Lifetime is set to 3 by default
- Direction is set to `workspace.GlobalWind` by default
- Speed is set to 6 by default
- SpawnRate is set to 25 by default

```lua
	local Windline = require(ReplicatedStorage.Packages.Windline)

Cleanup all existing windline/streaks as well as flush the internal update queue.

### Create

> Windline:Create( `settings` \{ Lifetime: number?, Direction: Vector3?, Speed: number?, Position: Vector3?, } ) -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Create a new wind streak, the 'settings' table passed defines the scope of this streak/line

- Lifetime by default is set to what the `:Init` function settings has.
- Direction by default is set to what the `:Init` function settings has.
- Speed by default is set to what the `:Init` function settings has.
- Position by default is set to a randomized point around the players camera.

```lua
	local Windline = require(ReplicatedStorage.Packages.Windline)
	
	Windline:Create({
		Lifetime = 3,
		Direction = workspace.GlobalWind,
		Speed = 6,
		Position = workspace.Object.Position,
	})
