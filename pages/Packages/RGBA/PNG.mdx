# PNGObject
The PNG Object enables a developer to write Roblox's flat RGBA array into a PNG file format, allowing developers to export
	the contents of `EditableImage:ReadPixels`, which could come in handy for things such as Plugins.

Most of the work is done upon creating this class, essentially all you have to do as a dev is call `:ToString` to get the
	binary blob, the image itself.

TL;DR, this is a PNG encoder.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
	Any PNG file created through this encoder will export an image w/o compression, true color with alpha.

## Properties
## Methods
### ToString

> PNGObject:ToString() ->  [string](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/strings) 

Returns the binary blob for the PNG file, this is essentially the content you'd find under a `object.png` file.

## Functions
### new

> PNGObject.new( `size` [Vector2](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/reference/engine/datatypes/Vector2), `rgba` \{ [number]: number } ) ->  PNGObject 

Constructor function that creates a new PNG file, when this function is called, the binary data for the RGBA array will
	be generated alongside this call.

```lua
	local pixels = EditableImage:ReadPixels()
	local pngObject = RGBA.PNG.new(EditableImage.Size, pixels)

	HttpService:PostAsync("https://some-image-uploading-site/upload", pngObject:ToString())
```
