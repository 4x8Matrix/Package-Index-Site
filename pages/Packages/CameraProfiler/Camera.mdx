# Camera Object
The base camera object that the end developer will be interacting with, think of this object as an extendable class that you'll overwrite lifecycle methods on.

## Properties
### Name
> Camera Object.Name \<[string](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/strings)>



### Instance
> Camera Object.Instance \<[Instance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/reference/engine/datatypes/Instance)>



## Methods
### OnActivated

> Camera Object:OnActivated() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Lifecycle method that'll invoke once the camera has been activated

```lua
	local cameraObject = CameraProfile.Camera.new("DefaultCamera")

	function cameraObject:OnActivated()
		renderStepPrep()
	end
```

---
### OnDeactivated

> Camera Object:OnDeactivated() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Lifecycle method that'll invoke once the camera has been deactivated

```lua
	local cameraObject = CameraProfile.Camera.new("DefaultCamera")

	function cameraObject:OnDeactivated()
		cleanUpCamera()
	end
```

---
### OnRenderStepped

> Camera Object:OnRenderStepped() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Render Stepped lifecycle method that'll be called each render stepped when the camera is active

```lua
	local cameraObject = CameraProfile.Camera.new("DefaultCamera")

	function cameraObject:OnRenderStepped()
		self.Instance.CFrame = CFrame.new(1, 0, 1)
	end
```

---
### InvokeLifecycleMethod

> Camera Object:InvokeLifecycleMethod() ->  ... 

Attempt to execute a camera object's lifecycle method

```lua
	local cameraObject = CameraProfile.Camera.new("DefaultCamera")

	function cameraObject:methodName(a, b, c)
		print(a, b, c) -- 1, 2, 3
	end

	cameraObject:InvokeLifecycleMethod("methodName", 1, 2, 3)
```

---
### ToString

> Camera Object:ToString() ->  [string](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/strings) 

Get a string'd version of the current Camera instance

```lua
	CameraProfile.Camera.new("DefaultCamera"):ToString() -- > "Camera<"DefaultCamera">"
```

---
## Functions
### wrap

> Camera Object.wrap( `name` [string](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/strings), `cameraInstance` [Instance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/reference/engine/datatypes/Instance) ) ->  Camera Object 

Wrap around a Camera instance, the goal being to allow developers to wrap around already instantiated camera objects.

```lua
	-- wrap around the current workspace camera!

	CameraProfile.Camera.wrap("DefaultCamera", workspace.CurrentCamera)
```

---
### new

> Camera Object.new( `name` [string](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/strings) ) ->  Camera Object 

Generate a new camera instance

```lua
	CameraProfile.Camera.new("CustomCamera")
```

---
### is

> Camera Object.is( `object` any ) ->  [boolean](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/booleans) 

Validate if an object is a camera object

```lua
	CameraProfile.Camera.is(
		CameraProfile.Camera.new("CustomCamera")
	) -- > true

	CameraProfile.Camera.is(
		123
	) -- > false
```

---
### get

> Camera Object.get( `name` [string](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/strings) ) ->  Camera Object? 

Get a camera object from it's camera name

```lua
	CameraProfile.Camera.get("DefaultCamera")
